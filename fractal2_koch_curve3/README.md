# Canvas2D Template

This is the Canvas2D template project for IGME-790.01.2181 (Fall 2018). It is
setup with the HTML, CSS, and Javascript to provide a canvas element that is
scaled to be the full width and height of the document window. It will also
update width and height on resizes. We will be working in the app.js file
almost exclusively to program our projects and write our visual drawing code.
